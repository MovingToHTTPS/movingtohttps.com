                            <p>As most SSL providers now supply a 2048-bit key or higher by default, your first question really is, what sort of certificate do you want?</p>
                            <p>There are 3 main types of certificates you can choose from for your site:</p>

                                        <li v-else>Free via Let's Encrypt &amp; Cloudflare, or purchase available.</li>
                                        <li>Normally issued in minutes.</li>

                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Shows organization in URL bar as well as within the certificate.</li>
                                        <li>Requires purchase, more expensive.</li>
                                        <li>Can take up to a week to issue.</li>

                            <p v-if="hosting == 'cloudflare'">With Cloudflare, you get free DV certificates, however they do not allow use of custom certificates unless you use their Business ($200 a month) plan.</p>

                            <p>For most sites, DV certificates are exactly what you're looking for. But it's worth considering EV certificates as they show the organization in the URL bar.</p>
                            <p>Another consideration is do you need this certificate for a single domain/subdomain or for multiple. There are single domain, multi domain and wildcard (all subdomains) certificates available from most SSL providers, though Let's Encrypt &amp; Cloudflare require you setup each subdomain separately.</p>

                            <p>If you're just looking to secure your main domain a 1 or 2 DV certificates will work perfectly.
                                <br>Free DV certificates are available with <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare</a>

                            </p>

                            <p>If you're interested in an OV or EV certificate, best to go ahead and purchase these in advance as they can take several days to be issued. They will also require proof of the organization's existence. But if you're selecting a DV certificate then you can wait till the moving day.</p>

                            <p>Once you've selected the certificate you're interested in you can move on to start migrating, but consider the following points to make sure you don't miss anything.</p>

                            <p v-if="hosting == 'cloudflare'">Cloudflares free certificate covers multiple subdomains but wildcard support is restricted to their Business plan. The certificates also <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/203041594-What-browsers-work-with-CloudFlare-s-SSL-certificates-">do not support</a> old browser/OS combinations such as Windows XP or OS X 10.5 or less.</p>

                            <p>If you use Load Balancers in front of your web servers then you'll later be installing the certificates onto these instead of the actual web servers. Some load balancers such as AWS ELB offer free SSL which could.</p>

                            <h3>Check to see if your hosting / provider already offers FREE SSL</h3>
                            <p>Though this is not yet the norm, as HTTPS becomes the default for a lot of sites, providers are starting to offer SSL included with hosting packages. It's worth contacting them to be sure.</p>

                                At the time of writing this, Weebly only support SSL on the Business+ plans and do not yet support custom SSL certificates. However you should be able to use Cloudflare to get around this for free.

                            <h3>Do you have a test site?</h3>
                            <p>This is optional as most sites don't have access to a test site, nor will many sites actually require one anyway.</p>
                            <p>But if you are able to, making these changes on a test / staging version of your site first would reduce the risk that comes from editing a production site. </p>

                            <h3>Dedicate some time to your migration</h3>
                            <p>Installing a certificate can be pretty quick, though the actual full migration process can take a good chunk of time to properly complete. We'd advise starting the moving day portion of this guide when you have a few hours free. If everything goes smoothly it may take much less time, but it's worth having that spare time just in case.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>Make sure everyone involved in the site knows the migration is happening.</h3>
                            <p>For example, if your site has a separate marketing person or team, let them know what will be changing. Later on we'll be updating 3rd party links and they may need to be aware of the changes and make changes of their own.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>How will you track changes?</h3>
                            <p>In the event that the migration causes some short term disruptions in traffic and/or search rank, you'll want stats to fall back on and provide visibility of what exactly changed.</p>
                            <p>If you haven't already, setup <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.google.co.uk/analytics/">Google Analytics</a> or a similar service and let it run for at least a week to get a good idea of current traffic &amp; behaviour.</p>
                            <p>It's also worth making sure you have <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/">Google Search Console</a> (Webmaster tools) setup to track indexed pages and keywords used to find your site along with average position. You may also want to check out <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.bing.com/toolbox/webmaster">Bing's Webmaster Tools</a>.</p>

                            <h3>Consider making some changes pre migration</h3>
                            <p>Some changes such as fixing mixed content can often be done before the move.
                                <br>We've listed it later on as part of the migration flow, but feel free to skip ahead through the guide to ease the changes later.
                                <br>Other changes such as redirects &amp; 3rd party changes must wait 'til you first have SSL installed.
                            </p>

                        <li>
                            <h3>Do you plan to move your entire site or just specific areas first?</h3>
                            <p>If you can, moving your entire site. It means more work upfront but given the SEO benefits and knowledge that your entire site is encrypted for users is worth it.</p>
                            <p>However, not all sites are able to do this at one, at the very least you'll need to setup HTTPS for any login forms, payment pages and any pages that require or reveal user details.</p>
                            <p>The rest of guide currently assumes you're moving your entire site so some parts of this you can skip or modify. E.g. you'll want to skip changing most 3rd party settings if the majority of your site is still over HTTP instead of HTTPS. You'd also want to not set up an entire site redirect, but instead redirect just the specific pages / sections over HTTPS and potentially setup redirects going the other way for pages required over HTTP fro HTTPS.</p>

                            <p>During the migration you'll need to be aware of all variations of your site such as multiple languages or location based changes or even AB tests in progress? During the mixed content fixing step you'll need to check all variations.</p>

This is often blocked in browsers but can leave parts of your site broken because of this.
                            <br>The other type is passive mixed content, such as images, which are less dangerous, but still an issue and though not blocked in the browser, having these will replace your green HTTPS &amp; lock symbol with a grey version indicating it's over HTTPS but has issues.</p>

                            <p>There are a few ways to find mixed content on your site, the simplest is to load up pages and use your browser's developer tools to see warnings. But doing this over an entire site would likely be either very slow or impossible.</p>

                            <p>Instead, the main ways sites are normally checked are through:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>
                                    Using a tool to externally crawl over your site at once.

                                    These crawling tools work with any site as they are run externally. Here are some examples:

                                    There are some WordPress plugins dedicated to HTTPS migration help, these will also assist in the following steps so worth checking them out before continuing.
                                    <br>
                                    For WordPress sites, these are usually our recommended way to go, but could be combined with the tools above to be extra safe.
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/really-simple-ssl/">Really Simple SSL</a></li>

                                    CSP (Content Security Policy) reporting, which is a way to tell browsers to send issue reports back to you as users navigate through your site.
                                    <br>

                                        Though setting this up usually requires access to the code or to install plugins to your platform so we'll skip this.

                                        It's usually a regarded as the more complete option as it catches any ajax issues that crawling may not find, though it requires you first have users visiting pages with mixed content on to report them. It also only works if you have access to modify the HTTP response headers of your site, plugins can often accomplish this though.

                                        CSP violations can be sent back to a central server for you to monitor them and receive alerts, here's a few examples:

                            <p>Once you've got a good way to identify any mixed content issues on your site you can start fixing any found.</p>

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>Fix mixed content</h3>

                            <p v-if="platform == 'wordpress'">
                                The above WordPress plugins can help fix issues, the following will help with areas you need to manually change though.
                            </p>
                            <p v-if="platform == 'rec'">
                                To fix any issues found in Blog post older reference blocks run: Admin > Blog Settings > "Fix Mixed Content Reference Blocks".
                            </p>

                            <p>The essence of fixing mixed content issues is to replace links to HTTP resources with HTTPS.</p>
                            <p>E.g. <code>&lt;img src=&quot;http://site.com/image.png&quot;&gt;</code>
                                <br>Would need replacing with <code>&lt;img src=&quot;https://site.com/image.png&quot;&gt;</code> to load over HTTPS instead.
                            </p>

                            <p>Sometimes a HTTPS version of something may not yet be available, in this case you could download the resource and host it yourself on your newly HTTPS site.</p>

                            <p v-if="control == 'max'">
                                Another option to help the migration process is to use the CSP header of "upgrade-insecure-requests" <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://caniuse.com/#feat=upgradeinsecurerequests">(Browser support is fairly good and improving)</a>. You can <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/security/prevent-mixed-content/fixing-mixed-content#upgrading_insecure_requests">read more about this here</a>.
                                This is probably the nicest way to do it, but requires the resource actually have a HTTPS version available, so worth checking or reporting these issues too.
                            </p>
                            <p v-if="control == 'max'">
                                You could also use CSP set to block all non HTTPS requests, though this will result in broken images, style &amp; scripts that, so using this with the reporting services above would be wanted.
                            </p>

                            <p>To test, recheck your site with the tools used in the previous step.</p>

                            <p>Usually grouped in with mixed content, forms that have insecure / HTTP actions set. This is because even if you redirect your whole site, the form data would still first be sent over HTTP to hit the redirect and then go over HTTPS, exposing the data in that in-between HTTP step.</p>
                            <p>The same is true for redirects such as redirects to URLs logged in areas of a site.</p>
                            <p>The above mixed content checking tools can help you track these down too.</p>

                                Setup your nginx conf file with the following redirect to HTTPS:

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name site.com www.site.com;

                                Setup your .htaccess file with the following redirect to HTTPS:

RewriteCond %{SERVER_PORT} 80
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://site.com/$1 [R=301,L]</code>
                            </p>

                            <p>After setting this redirect up it's important to test it doesn't just send users to the homepage, but rather it redirect any request path to the same path but over HTTPS. E.g. http://site.com/info/contact.html redirects to https://site.com/info/contact.html.</p>
                            <p>If you're site redirects non-www traffic to the www version, or vise versa, make sure to update these redirects too so you don't end up with double or more redirect steps.</p>

                            <h3>Implement HSTS (HTTP Strict-Transport-Security)</h3>
                            <p>One of the main reasons to wait a day or so is to make sure you don't need to back out of this.
                                <br>With HSTS you can tell browsers when users visit your site to only request from the HTTPS version of the site, no interactions over HTTP.</p>

                            <p>All that's needed for this is to add the "Strict-Transport-Security" to your site with a max age set to 6 months in seconds (15768000)</p>

                            <p v-if="platform == 'wordpress'">The Really Simple SSL WordPress plugin mentioned above handles setting this up for you.</p>

                            <p>You should make a note of when your certificate expires on a calendar to be safe. </p>
                            <p>Even if you've setup automatic renewal of the certificate, you still need to be sure that it works. Better to test yourself than have a customer call up and point it out to you.</p>
                            <p>With other SSL providers, they normally email you before renewal but it's still best to be safe and keep track of this date yourself.</p>
                            <p>Consider also making notes on how you installed the certificate previously for your future self to reference.</p>

                            <p>Even with a redirect from HTTP to HTTPS setup, it's best to minimize temp HTTP redirects as these can still lead to exposing what the user was doing.</p>
                            <p v-if="control == 'max'">To ease the pain of this, if you have access to the code and/or the database you could run a find and replace over all content for <code>href="http://yoursite.com</code> with <code>href="https://yoursite.com</code></p>

                            <p>If you've previously set up your HSTS header, you could now opt to preload this into browsers before users even get to your site.</p>
